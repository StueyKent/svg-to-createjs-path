## Paths

> Simple or compound shape outlines are drawn with curved or straight lines that can be filled in, outlined, or used as a clipping path. Paths have a compact coding.
For example, M (for “move to”) precedes initial numeric x and y coordinates, and L (for “line to”) precedes a point to which a line should be drawn. Further command letters (C, S, Q, T, and A) precede data that is used to draw various Bézier and elliptical curves. Z is used to close a path.
In all cases, absolute coordinates follow capital letter commands and relative coordinates are used after the equivalent lower-case letters. [1][1]
